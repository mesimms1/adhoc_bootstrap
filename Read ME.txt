Codecademy Assignment to test my bootstrap learning

It was a project to complete the bootstrap class found at codecademy.com The objective was to make a website that looked like a provided design spec using html and bootstrap. The design spec is available at the bottom of this webpage for comparison.

Codecademy tested general bootstrap understanding, including:

    Setting up bootstrap and laying out the framework for the webpage
    Using a bootstrap navbar and collapsible menu feature for responsive design
    Adding and customizing a jumbotron feature, including making it 'fluid'
    Adding and customizing a card deck
    Adding and customizing a carousel

In addition to the requirements, I also included an extra collapse feature, extra jumbotron-fluid. Furthermore, I did this assignment entirely from scratch, using VSC instead of following the provide codecademy code. Finally, I used git bash for version control. And for launching this repository on github.

This was an exercise to test and solidify learning. It is not to be used as a project or as an exhibition of my skills with bootstrap. Instead, it is a project that was used as a sandbox to test my coding abilities and continue to learn as a new web developer.
